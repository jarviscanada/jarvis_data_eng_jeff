# Jeff Li . Jarvis Consulting

I am a graduate of the University of Toronto with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The whole reason I am interested in Computer Science, in general, is the fact that there is such a wide application of the profession. I have experience working in agile scrum teams both as a developer and a QA. Outside of work, I have an interest in Gaming, Game Design, Reading, as well as history. What makes me enthusiastic about working in data engineering is that only for the past few decades does there exist recorded data that can be used in the way of "data engineering" making this a new and interesting frontier that I am interested in being a part of.

- **[Cluster Monitor](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_jeff/tree/master/linux_sql)**:Wrote a continuous monitoring of multiple web servers and their CPU output so as to be able to provide updates about how the CPU for each is doing. The project is implemented in Bash scripts, hosted on a docker container, and uses the cronjob scheduler.
- **[Core Java Apps](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_jeff/tree/master/core_java)**: Created a collection of individual smaller projects that are designed to help learn about lambda functions, DAO access patterns as well as RESTful API calls. These skills are learned through the implementation of command-line grep, and Twitter GET POST and DELETE service.

## Education & Academic Projects

**University of Toronto (2016-2020)**, Bachelor of Science, Computer Science

- **Mock Linux Command Line Interface:** Developed a mock Linux command-line interface that handled basic bash commands like `mkdir`, `ls` and `ln`. The CLI mocked similar behaviour as a proper Linux file system in functionality as well as memory management. The project was developed in C so to be able to control memory storage.

- **Hacking CTF challenges:** Worked on various capture the flag hacking challenges involved with breaking through basic security.  Challenges included various security exploits such as packet sniffing, cross-site scripting, and SQL injections.

- **Developer, WorldScribe website 2019:** Developed a writer's tool to track storytelling elements by tracking story elements (ie, characters, settings) in an accessible manner. I was involved with developing the front-end written in React with Material-UI interface, helping and designing the layout and interfaces of the project.
